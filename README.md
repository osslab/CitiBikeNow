This project shows remained Citi Bike numbers at each bike station in real time. Citi Bike station feed data from <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data">Citi Bike NYC</a> visualized by Processing and <a href="http://unfoldingmaps.org/" target="_blank">Unfolding map Library</a>. 

The feed data was not provide with GeoJson format used in Unfolding map Library. Thus, I converted the raw data to GeoJson format. 

This project was selected as <a href="http://unfoldingmaps.org/2014unfolded.html" target="_blank"> a June project in the 2014 project review of Unfolding map.</a>

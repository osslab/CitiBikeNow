This project shows remained Citi Bike numbers at each bike station in real time. Citi Bike station feed data from <a href="https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data">Citi Bike NYC</a> visualized by Processing and <a href="http://unfoldingmaps.org/" target="_blank">Unfolding map Library</a>. 

The feed data was not provide with GeoJson format which is used in Unfolding map Library. Thus, I converted the raw data to GeoJson format. 

I designed and developed this project for ITP camp 2014. <a href="http://davidptracy.com" target="_blank">David Tracy</a>, a camp counselor, and <a href="http://tkudinova.com"  target="_blank">Tatja Kudinova</a>, a camp instigator, gave an advice about color and shape of data.

This project was selected as <a href="http://unfoldingmaps.org/2014unfolded.html" target="_blank"> a June project in the 2014 project review of Unfolding map.</a>
